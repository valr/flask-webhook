# flask-webhook

flask-webhook is a simple Flask application storing the payload of webhook events.

Only the [Github events](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads) are currently supported.  
The payload of events is first validated and then stored in a defined location.
